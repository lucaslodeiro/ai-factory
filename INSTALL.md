# macOS installation

Use Node 22 or newer (Node 22 LTS recommended), Git, GitHub CLI, Codex CLI and Claude Code. Authenticate `gh auth login`, `codex login`, and `claude auth login` before starting.

```sh
git clone --branch bootstrap/mvp https://github.com/lucaslodeiro/ai-factory.git
cd ai-factory
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `FACTORY_REPO_DIR` to a clone of the **target application**, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` to its owner/name, `GITHUB_DEFAULT_BRANCH` to its base branch and `FACTORY_APPROVERS` to the comma-separated GitHub logins who can make decisions. Use a different `FACTORY_DATA_DIR` per target. The local target clone needs origin configured, the base branch pushed, and Git author name/email configured. Worktrees start at the fetched remote base; uncommitted changes in the source checkout are not included.

The daemon reads `.env` from its working directory. Run commands from the factory checkout. `CODEX_COMMAND`, `CLAUDE_COMMAND` and `GIT_COMMAND` accept absolute executable paths (not shell command strings). Ensure Node 22+ and the working Git executable are first in PATH so worker tools find them too. On Macs with multiple Git installations, an Xcode license error can be avoided by selecting a separately installed Git.

```sh
npm run factory -- doctor
npm run factory -- start
# In another terminal, in the same directory:
npm run factory -- status
npm run factory -- events <work-item-id>
npm run factory -- cancel <work-item-id-or-run-id>
npm run factory -- retry <work-item-id>
npm run factory -- stop
```

`start` runs in the foreground. A lock prevents a second daemon for the same data directory. `cancel`, `retry` and `stop` persist requests; the running daemon acknowledges them in `events`. If stopped, run `start` to process queued requests. Stop pauses active items and terminates their agents; restart then retry each paused item explicitly. Status and events never perform recovery. Cancelled/failed/paused items preserve their retry stage. Retry only after the previous process has stopped and its worktree has been inspected.

Agent timeouts are configurable. SIGTERM escalates to SIGKILL after one second for a process group that does not exit. After a crash, interrupted executions are recorded as interrupted and the work item becomes FAILED. A stage checkpoint also detects crashes after provider exit but before the workflow state was committed. Each new run has a supervisor connected to the daemon by IPC. If the daemon dies, the supervisor terminates its worker group. Retry checks that any interrupted group is gone before proceeding, without signalling saved PIDs. Old bootstrap runs without a supervisor may still require manual process inspection. Worktrees and logs are retained for diagnosis.

## First end-to-end run

Create the `factory:queued` label in the target repository, then create a feature issue carrying that label. Product/Architect runs in a fresh Claude process. Questions are posted on the issue; answer with a standalone command:

```text
/factory answer <your answer or requested changes>
```

The proposed spec is versioned in SQLite and posted to GitHub. Approve its exact version:

```text
/factory approve v1
```

Only configured approvers with GitHub user accounts can approve. Quoted commands, stale versions and bot comments are ignored. Editing an old comment is not a new decision: post a new comment. After approval, Developer and QA run in separate Codex processes; Reviewer runs in a separate Claude process. Passing review pushes the work branch and creates a PR. The factory never merges it.

Findings route automatically to Developer or Product/Architect. Product/Architect can resolve tactical consultations under the same approved spec without human interruption. Major changes and revised specs require a new approval. After the configured correction limit, human guidance is required. QA may change files under test/tests/spec directories or files named `.test.*` / `.spec.*`; other changes fail the run for inspection. Adjust your test layout to this MVP policy.

## Credentials and isolation

Worker environments contain only basic OS variables, provider config location and explicitly allowlisted variables. Local provider credential stores remain available for CLI authentication. This is an environment filter, not a security boundary against malicious code running as your user. Use trusted repositories or an external sandbox/account for untrusted code. Codex uses workspace-write sandbox with network access. Claude Product/Reviewer receive read/search/web tools only. Role mutation checks reject unexpected worktree edits before committing. The orchestrator owns commits, pushes and PR creation. It verifies the assigned branch before executing agents and before committing, rejects detached HEAD, and checks both source and destination of renames against role restrictions.

GitHub comments use a durable, idempotent delivery queue. If reading human replies fails, the item remains waiting and retries on the next poll without losing its approval cursor. Slack is optional and uses its own persistent queue. Failures retry with backoff up to five minutes without blocking the workflow. Human-action messages contain an issue link, question/spec summary and response command. Delivery is at least once, so a crash during acknowledgement can cause a duplicate. SQLite, specs, reports and execution logs live under `FACTORY_DATA_DIR`. Do not commit them or `.env`.

## Provider references

- [Codex non-interactive execution](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/non-interactive-mode)
- [Claude programmatic execution](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless)
- [Claude installation and authentication](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup)

## Current boundaries

One foreground daemon per target/data directory, sequential work-item execution, no automatic merge, and no remote execution service. Claude and Codex accounts must be authenticated locally. Old bootstrap items without issue context are rejected explicitly; use a fresh data directory for the first run. Unit/integration tests simulate provider reasoning and GitHub; a live provider demo is a separate acceptance check.

## Slack configuration and diagnosis

Set `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` only in your local `.env`. Run `npm run factory -- slack-test` to send one explicitly requested test message. Use `npm run factory -- notifications` to inspect pending/sent deliveries, attempts and retry times. The daemon retries pending notifications after restart. If Slack is disabled, messages remain pending until it is configured. Do not put webhook secrets into GitHub issues or tracked files.

## Structured reports and upgrades

All provider results now require coverage, test evidence, changed files, dependency rationale, decisions and review checks. See `templates/EXECUTION_RESULT.md`. Schemas migrate transactionally when opening SQLite, including concurrent CLI/daemon startup. Previously approved specs without structured acceptance criteria are not silently grandfathered into PASS: regenerate and approve a new spec. Existing raw agent outputs remain in the audit history.

`status` shows the saved retry stage and any interrupted stage checkpoint. Partial work is retained; retry reruns the stage and asks the worker to inspect and verify it. Processes that deliberately detach into other groups and legacy pre-supervisor runs may require manual inspection.

## Models per task

Run `npm run factory -- models` to inspect the balanced policy's explicit model mappings. Override the six model variables in `.env.example` to match your account. `npm run factory -- models <work-item-id>` previews the next selections without running providers. New specs include a complexity/risk assessment for your approval. See [model policy](docs/MODEL_POLICY.md) for routing, correction escalation, audit events and legacy behavior. Model availability is checked by the actual provider invocation, not by `doctor`; a rejected model requires configuration correction and explicit retry.

Worker prompts include the actual daemon Node executable and configured Git, plus an explicit PATH prefix for shell commands: login-shell startup files may otherwise select an older Node or Xcode Git. Verify the tool versions in run logs. Reviewer receives QA commands/results as attributed evidence and does not claim to have executed them personally.
